				<p class="p1" class="responsive">Beginning in February 2025, I attended Bath Spa university's ClickStart program, to improve my web development, UX/UI design and to focus his marketing efforts. I've focused mainly on web design and on UX/UI elements, as I hope to market my upcoming novel <i>Wormfeed</i> using web tools, reaching out to industry contacts with an aesthetic portfolio of work as my chief marketing tool. <a href="portfolio.html">Read more</a></p>

				<img src="employability.png" class="responsive">
				<p class="p1" class="responsive">After a long, hard year of turning up to lectures twice(!) a week, I submitted my Master's dissertation, focusing on how using 'unconventional' gender roles in 12,000 words of original writing caused tension within a 'conventional' piece of detective fiction, relating to my splicing of elements of bildungsroman into a conventionally hard-boiled and patriarchal genre.</p>

				<img src="IMG_5251.jpg" alt="Ben Netherway" style="display: block; margin: auto;" class="responsive"><!--Image--><p class="p1">Benjamin Netherway is a Bristol based Welsh writer, currently learning all there is to know about e-marketing, web design and UX/ UX essentials to compliment his upcoming novel <i>Wormfeed</i>.<br>
				In my free time I enjoy playing instruments, reading and drinking unhealthy quantities of beer. I've always been interested in technology, building computers since a boy and working in technical roles for educational institutions. <br>
				I am fascinated, if worried about the role of technology on our society; I enjoy writing about humanity's connection to the real, and how intangible sillicon valley projects interact with tactile, every-day working people.</p>
